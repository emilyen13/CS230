Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room is a client that desires to take their already existing mobile game, Draw It or Lose It, and expand to a web based version of that same game that is available across multiple platforms and/or devices. Draw it or lose it is a puzzle game where competing teams attempt to guess an images as it slowly renders on their device. The Gaming Room had many specifications for their desired team and player settings. They desired advice in regards to what operating system would best fist their needs, and storage methods to go along with those needs.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

As I follwed the supplied software design document outline, I feel I supplied a well thought out and comprehensive explanation and comparison of the different operating system options. After forming those comparisons I was able to consider the operating systems and the clients needs and articulate a recommendation based on the provided information. I feel I wrote my explanation and recommendation in a way that would be understandable for a partner or client who is not well versed in the computer science industry. 

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Analyzing the provided UML diagram was helpful when it came to the code and understanding the innerworkings of the relationships. That said, I will say the coding was the most challenging part of this entire 8 weeks for me. I did not feel prepared, or supported by our supplied resources for this class and definitely should have asked for more assistance. Something I stuggle most with in my classes, especially in this style of all virtual school, is knowing when to ask for help. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I did not like how we were directed to display our operating system comparisons in chart form. Perhaps I wrote too much in those boxes, but I felt in order to fully elaborate on all of the required elements, I needed to write as much as I did. I do not think having large paragraphs of information tightly squeezed into boxes is the most visually pleasing way to present the information. If I was to do it again, and with more freedom, I would have scrapped the boxes and just had seperate sections for each operating system, with bullet points breaking down all of the features, benefits and drawbacks.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

While it is the client hiring you to do a job, user needs are just as, if not more important in the long run. User's will drive the success or failure of a product, and failing the user can often lead to failing the client. The user needs to be able to easily access their profile within the game no matter the device they are using, the other important thing is security. Keeping our user's data safe for them is something that needs to be taken in to account during the design process.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

Designing software definitely can seem daunting at the start, at least it has to me. Starting by initially focusing more vaugely on what the client is asking for and from there working towards finding the best fit design to meet all of their criteria wound up feeling like a successful method. Its important to break out functional requirements, design contraints, and business objectives in this process as well. I definitely struggled early in this class distinguishing between these characteristics, and dividing them up appropriately is vital to the understanding of the client.
